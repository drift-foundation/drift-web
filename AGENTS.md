# Repo Agent Rules

## Drift context (required)

This repository is a Drift user-land library. Agents must understand core Drift semantics before making changes.

- Drift is a systems language with explicit ownership and moves.
- Borrowing/reference rules are enforced by the compiler.
- Resource lifetime is deterministic (RAII-style destruction), no GC assumptions.
- Concurrency is designed around Drift runtime primitives and virtual-thread style scheduling.

Primary docs (read first):

- Docs root: `https://github.com/drift-foundation/lang-toolchain/tree/main/docs`
- Language spec: `https://github.com/drift-foundation/lang-toolchain/tree/main/docs/design/drift-lang-spec.md`
- Stdlib spec: `https://github.com/drift-foundation/lang-toolchain/tree/main/docs/design/drift-stdlib-spec.md`
- Concurrency design: `https://github.com/drift-foundation/lang-toolchain/tree/main/docs/design/drift-concurrency.md`
- Tooling/packages: `https://github.com/drift-foundation/lang-toolchain/tree/main/docs/design/drift-tooling-and-packages.md`
- Effective guide: `https://github.com/drift-foundation/lang-toolchain/tree/main/docs/effective-drift.md`

Drift dependency policy:

- This repo tracks `drift-foundation/lang-toolchain` `main`.
- Compatibility target is current `main`, not historical snapshots.
- If a `main` change breaks this repo, treat it as immediate integration work.
- If breakage appears to be a Drift defect, follow the defect policy below and pin a minimal regression.

## Git usage (strict)

- Use `git` **only** for reviewing history or diffing (e.g. `git diff`, `git log`, `git show`, `git blame`).
- **Do not** stage or unstage changes (`git add`, `git restore --staged`, etc.) without explicit permission.
- **Do not** perform any mutating git operations without explicit permission (including `git commit`, `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git cherry-pick`, `git reset`, `git checkout/switch`, `git stash`, and tag/branch operations).
- **Do not** wrap long lines (calls with many arguments, long expressions) for readability; avoid indentation churn, especially if code is deeply nested.
- **Do not** edit existing tests without clear confirmation it is OK. Do not bend tests around defects.

## Defect policy (strict)

- If behavior indicates a core defect (protocol parsing, state machine, concurrency, memory/lifetime, I/O correctness, or runtime integration), classify it immediately as `CORE_BUG`.
- Do not patch user-facing API code to avoid triggering a suspected `CORE_BUG` unless explicitly approved as a temporary workaround.

### Regression-first requirement (mandatory)

For every suspected `CORE_BUG`, do this in order:

1. Add a minimal failing regression test (prefer e2e/integration when relevant, unit otherwise).
2. Confirm it fails on current behavior.
3. Fix the root cause.
4. Confirm regression passes.
5. Only then consider refactor/cleanup.

### No semantic masking

Forbidden without explicit approval:

- Rewriting control flow primarily to bypass correctness defects.
- Rewriting ownership/lifetime patterns primarily to hide memory/concurrency defects.
- Any source change whose main purpose is to avoid fixing root cause.

### Stop-and-confirm gate

On first detection of a likely `CORE_BUG`, stop broader implementation changes and notify with:

- minimal repro
- failing test path
- suspected subsystem

Then continue with root-cause fix by default; ask before any temporary workaround.

### Temporary workaround protocol (opt-in only)

If user explicitly requests a temporary workaround:

- Keep it minimal and localized.
- Add a `progress.md` (or `TODO.md`) note referencing regression test and bug label.
- Do not mark complete until root-cause fix is landed or explicitly deferred.

### Completion criteria

A `CORE_BUG` is not done unless both are present:

- pinned regression test
- root-cause fix

Workaround-only changes must be reported as partial, not final resolution.
